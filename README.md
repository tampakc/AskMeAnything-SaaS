***Edit:*** *This application is no longer hosted on heroku, the links below are dead.*
The aim of this assignment was to create a site, hosting questions and answers similar to StackOverflow, using two different architectures.
Both versions of the site are functional and are hosted on Heroku, and can be visited using the following hyperlinks *(due to the fact that each component is hosted separately and is not always active,
please note that there will be loading times the first time you load each page)*:
- [SOA Architecture](http://saas-45-soa-frontend.herokuapp.com/)
- [Microservices Architecture](http://saas-45-microservices-frontend.herokuapp.com/)
